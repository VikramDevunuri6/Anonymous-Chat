## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open Your Browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - The application will automatically assign you an anonymous identity
   - Start chatting!

## How It Works

### Anonymous Identity System
- Each user gets a randomly assigned anonymous name and color
- No registration or login required
- No personal information is stored or tracked
- Users are identified only by their temporary session

### Message System
- Messages are broadcast to all connected users in real-time
- Each message shows the anonymous sender name and timestamp
- Messages are temporarily stored (last 100 messages) for new users joining
- No message persistence - messages are lost when server restarts

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for WebSocket connections
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **UUID Generation**: For unique message and user identification

## File Structure

```
anonymous-chat-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js          # Main server file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json       # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # This file
â””â”€â”€ public/
    â””â”€â”€ index.html     # Frontend application
```

## Customization

### Adding More Anonymous Names
Edit the `anonymousNames` array in `server.js`:

```javascript
const anonymousNames = [
    'Anonymous Owl', 'Silent Fox', 'Mystery Cat',
    // Add your own names here
];
```

### Changing Message Limit
Modify the `MAX_MESSAGES` constant in `server.js`:

```javascript
const MAX_MESSAGES = 100; // Change this number
```

### Styling
All CSS is contained in the `public/index.html` file. You can modify the styles in the `<style>` section.
